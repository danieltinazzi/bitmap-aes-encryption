This tool encrypt/decrypt text in a bitmap image using aes256 
It is written in JavaScript and it runs on NodeJS

Usage:
> npm install
> npm start

On your browser:
http://localhost:3000/encode/text_to_encode
http://localhost:3000/decode/base64_image_to_decode
(base64 image should be URI encoded to escape special characters)

Encoding example:
http://localhost:3000/encode/supersecretpassword123
Decoding example:
http://localhost:3000/decode/data%3Aimage%2Fbmp%3Bbase64%2CQk3CAAAAAAAAADYAAAAoAAAABgAAAAcAAAABABgAAAAAABAAAAATCwAAEwsAAAAAAAAAAAAAoAAAALkhgHjdQpJm5v9XsNCNAAC%2FbB0wJZpN6QmbLyYnln%2FCSc4AAE%2FYOILiWlSUPADhEfab%2BlQpQwAA9o7Mf5wLbyEyLSS%2F7lXS3lTzAAA9v5hsKfbdLWYoGdZqb%2Bb8A7UAANahrqtHFSElcJgt2AIJwpTN9gAAfnOrcA9pP3EAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA%3D

You can even pass base64 images to the encoding function if you want to crypt your images and save them on your drive.
Once you saved the crypted bitmap you can open it in your browser to see the base64 code in the url bar, in order to retrieve the encoded information.
Warning: saving the bitmap image on cloud services may cause image compression and the encoded information will be loss.
