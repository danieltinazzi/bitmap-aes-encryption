    h1 Bitmap encryption tool

    
    p This tool encrypt/decrypt text in a bitmap image using aes256 
    p It is written in JavaScript and it runs on NodeJS
     
    h3 Usage:
    p 1. Change the default encryption/decryption password in routes/index.js
    p 2. > npm install
    p 3. > npm start

    h3 On your browser:
    p http://localhost:3000/
    p You can encrypt text and decrypt images directly from the web interface.

    h3 URL usage:
    p http://localhost:3000/encode/text_to_encode
    p http://localhost:3000/decode/base64_image_to_decode
    p (base64 image should be URI encoded to escape special characters)

    h3 Encoding example:
    a(href='http://localhost:3000/encode/supersecretpassword123') http://localhost:3000/encode/supersecretpassword123

    h3 Decoding example:
    a(href='http://localhost:3000/decode/data%3Aimage%2Fbmp%3Bbase64%2CQk1%2BAAAAAAAAADYAAAAoAAAABAAAAAYAAAABABgAAAAAABAAAAATCwAAEwsAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAIiPDuRv2LtIqkxhmcs6sqSd1n627K%2FXXPxhEuq3EVYGED%2BVrlR3sRQoeDX%2F1jGgKhYn5VvW7jSvRVfNO7ZDVHQAAAAA') http://localhost:3000/decode/data%3Aimage%2Fbmp%3Bbase64%2CQk1%2BAAAAA...

    p You can even pass base64 images to the encoding function if you want to crypt your images and save them on your drive.

    p Warning: saving the bitmap image on cloud services may cause image compression and the encoded information will be loss.
